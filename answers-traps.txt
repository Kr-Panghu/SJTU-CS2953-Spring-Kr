1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in
main's call to printf ?

Ans: reg a0, a1, ..., a7 contain arguments. a2 holds 13. (li a2,13)

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g ? (Hint:
the compiler may inline functions.)

Ans: Function f and g is not called. 
In function main, we can see assembly (li a1,12), 
which means it has been calculated directly by the compiler 
in the compile optimization phase.

3. At what address is the function printf located?

Ans: In address 0x640.

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf inmain?

Ans: The ra register's value is 0x38 which is the next instruction after returnning from printf.

5. In the following code, what is going to be printed after y= ? (note: the answer is not a specific
value.) Why does this happen?
> printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

Ans: It'll print the value in the a2 register.
The 2-th argument "3" is passed to a1, but 3-th argument is missing,
so the result will depend on whatever there is before the call.
